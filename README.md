# Student Performance EDA

This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to student performance. The aim is to uncover key factors that influence student outcomes and provide insights into performance patterns.

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of student performance data to identify trends, correlations, and insights that could help educators, students, and policymakers better understand the key factors affecting academic performance. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and generating statistical summaries.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Student Performance Dataset](#)
- **Description**: This dataset contains features such as student demographics, study habits, grades, and parental background, which are relevant to academic performance.

## Features

Key features of the dataset include:
- **Gender**: The gender of the student.
- **Age**: Age of the student.
- **Study Time**: Amount of time spent studying.
- **Parental Education**: Highest level of parental education.
- **Test Scores**: Scores obtained in various subjects.
- **Free Time**: Time available after school.
- **Absences**: Number of school absences.

## Analysis Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values.
   - Standardized column names and formats.
   - Removed irrelevant columns or outliers.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Distribution of scores by gender.
   - Correlation between study time and performance.
   - Impact of parental education on student scores.
   - Scatter plots and heatmaps to explore feature relationships.

3. **Key Insights**:
   - Trends between student gender and performance in specific subjects.
   - How parental education level impacts student success.
   - The role of study habits and attendance in influencing test scores.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python**: Primary language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizing trends and correlations.
- **NumPy**: For numerical calculations and operations.

## Usage

To run this project locally, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/8077364606/Student-Performance-EDA.git
cd Student-Performance-EDA
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis:

```bash
jupyter notebook Student_Performance_EDA.ipynb
```

## Conclusion

The Student Performance EDA provides actionable insights into the factors affecting student academic success. Understanding these insights can help schools and educators optimize learning strategies, and guide students towards better performance.

## Future Scope

- Deep analysis of subject-wise performance trends.
- Exploring additional datasets for a more comprehensive study.
- Building a predictive model to forecast student success.
